# DESCRIPTION
The system is designed to assist in planning emergency travel routes between cities, considering both road and air routes.

## FEATURES

## Graph Representation:

Utilizes a graph data structure to model the connectivity between cities.
Implements an adjacency list representation for efficient storage and traversal.

## Menu-Driven Interface:

Provides a user-friendly menu interface for interacting with the system.
Options include inputting cases, specifying cities and routes, displaying graphical representations, and calculating minimum days to reach destinations.

## Graphical Representation:

Displays a graphical representation of aerial routes for a chosen case.
Shows the adjacency list for each city, aiding visualization of the connections.

## Minimum Days Calculation:

Calculates the minimum days required to reach the destination for each case.
Considers both road and air routes in the calculation.

## Input Validation:

Implements input validation to ensure the user provides valid information for the number of cities, routes, and source-destination pairs.

## Matrix Representation:

Displays the connections between vertices and the matrix representation of the graph.
Enhances understanding of the graph structure.

## How to run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/emergency-travel-system.git

g++ main.cpp -o emergency_travel_system

./emergency_travel_system
